DRAWING PROCESS

Now let's walk through how you actually draw something in this app. It's pretty straightforward:

First, you pick a tool - let's say you click on the Rectangle button. The app remembers "OK, we're drawing rectangles now."

Then you press your mouse button somewhere on the canvas. At that moment, the app creates a new Rectangle object and sets its starting point to where you clicked.

As you drag your mouse, the app continuously updates the end point of that rectangle and repaints the screen, so you can see the rectangle taking shape in real-time.

When you release the mouse button, the app finalizes that shape and adds it to the current layer. It also saves the current state so you can undo if you need to.

It's like digital finger painting, but with more precision!

SELECTION AND MANIPULATION

What about when you want to change something you've already drawn? That's where selection comes in.

When you click on the canvas in selection mode, the app checks all shapes from top to bottom to see if you clicked on one. It's like dropping a pin through a stack of paper - it hits the top sheet first.

Once a shape is selected, you'll see those little blue handles appear around it. Now you can:
- Move it by dragging from the middle
- Resize it by dragging those handles
- Delete it by hitting the Delete key
- Or change its layer order using the layer panel

It's pretty intuitive once you try it - just like moving things around in PowerPoint or other design software.

LAYER MANAGEMENT

Layers are super useful when you're creating more complex drawings. Think of them like transparent sheets stacked on top of each other.

The LayerPanel gives you buttons to create new layers, delete existing ones, toggle visibility with those checkboxes, and even reorder them with up and down buttons.

When it's time to draw the canvas, the app starts with the bottom layer and works its way up, drawing each visible layer in order. This way, shapes on higher layers appear on top of shapes on lower layers.

It's really handy when you want to work on one part of your drawing without messing up other parts.

UNDO/REDO IMPLEMENTATION

We've all made mistakes, right? That's why undo and redo are so important.

Every time you do something significant - like add a shape, move something, or delete something - the app takes a snapshot of the entire drawing state and pushes it onto the undo stack.

When you hit Ctrl+Z to undo, the app pops that state off the undo stack, pushes the current state onto the redo stack, and restores everything to how it was before.

And when you hit Ctrl+Y to redo, it does the opposite - takes from the redo stack and puts on the undo stack.

It's like having a time machine for your drawing!

FILE OPERATIONS

Of course, you'll want to save your masterpieces and maybe open them later.

When you save a drawing, the app renders all visible layers onto a single image and saves it as a PNG file. Simple and clean.

When you open an image, it loads that PNG and creates a new shape containing the image, which gets added to your current layer.

All this is handled by Java's ImageIO library, which makes working with image files pretty straightforward.

SPECIAL FEATURES

We've added some cool extras to make the app more professional:

For zooming and panning, you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and the middle mouse button to pan around. This is super helpful when you're working on detailed parts of your drawing.

We've also got a fancy splash screen that shows when the app starts up - with fade-in and fade-out animations and a progress bar. It gives the app a more polished, professional feel.

And for text, we built a custom font chooser dialog that lets you preview and select different fonts, styles, and sizes. Way better than just typing with a default font!

CODE EXAMPLES

[POINT TO CODE EXAMPLE SLIDE]

Here's a peek at how the code actually creates shapes. When you press your mouse button, the DrawingPanel checks what tool you've selected and creates the appropriate shape type.

For example, if you've selected the Circle tool, it creates a new Circle object with your current color, the coordinates where you clicked, and whether you want it filled or not.

[POINT TO SECOND CODE EXAMPLE]

And here's how the Rectangle's draw method works. It takes the Graphics object, sets up the stroke width and color, calculates the actual rectangle coordinates, and then either fills or outlines the rectangle depending on what you chose.

It's pretty elegant - each shape knows exactly how to draw itself when asked.

LESSONS LEARNED

Building this app taught us a lot about object-oriented design. Having a good inheritance hierarchy with Shape as the parent class made it really easy to add new shape types.

We also learned that event-driven programming can get complex quickly. Managing all those mouse and keyboard events, keeping track of what state the app is in - it requires careful planning.

And on the UI side, we found that it's important to balance features with usability. You want enough tools to be useful, but not so many that it becomes confusing.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

There's always room for improvement! Here are some things we could add in the future:

More shape types would be cool - like polygons, stars, or arrows.

We could enhance the text editing to allow formatting right on the canvas instead of through a dialog.

For layers, we could add features like layer groups or blend modes - kind of like what professional graphics software has.

Multiple selection would be super useful - letting you select and move several shapes at once.

And it would be great to have a native file format that preserves all the layers and editability, rather than just flattening everything to a PNG.

CONCLUSION

So that's our Interactive Drawing Tool! It demonstrates a bunch of important programming concepts:

- Object-oriented design with inheritance and polymorphism
- Event-driven programming for handling user interactions
- UI design principles for creative applications
- And how powerful Java Swing can be for building rich applications

We're pretty proud of what we've built - it has an intuitive drawing interface, layer-based organization, professional features like undo/redo, and an architecture that can be extended with new features.

Thanks for listening! Any questions?
